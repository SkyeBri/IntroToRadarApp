    <string name="propagationMedium">Propagation Medium is whatever the Radar\'s Electromagnetic Wave Pulses are moving through.\n\nUsually, that would be the surrounding air and whatever else is floating in it.</string>
    <string name="antenna">The antennae directs the energy from the transmitter to the area in space that you would like to look at to see if there is a target there, and receives reflected energy to forward to the receiver.</string>
    <string name="turnoverText"> This switch keeps the right wave pulse energy in the right places by forwarding the transmitter energy to the antenna without allowing it to leak into the receiver, and forwarding echos to the receive.\n\nAs the transmitter and receiver work together, there is a delay between transmitting waves and receiving reflected waves. This delay time indicates the distance from the target.</string>
    <string name="targetCrossSectionText">Radar Cross Section (RCS, or σ) is the effective cross-sectional area of the target as seen by the radar.</string>
    <string name="transmitterText">The Transmitter amplifies the waveform from the waveform generator and sends it to the switch.</string>
    <string name="transmitterSarcasmText">The transmitter transmits.\nWho would have thought?</string>
    <string name="waveformText">The Waveform Generator generates the electromagnetic wave pulses (form of the wave = waveform) for the RADAR to transmit. These range from microwave pulses to some radio wave pulse frequencies, though mostly in the microwave range. \n\nThe \"RA\" in RADAR stands for \"RAdio\" - Largely because radio frequencies were in common use at the time, and no one wanted to say \"Microwave Detection and Ranging\".</string>
    <string name="receiverText">The Receiver listens for incoming electromagnetic wave pulses that have been reflected off a target ("echos"). Received wave pulses could be RADAR waveforms bouncing off of a target, or bouncing off of clutter, or they could be noise from another source.</string>
    <string name="analogDigitalString">The Analog to Digital converter (A/D) converts the incoming echo energy into a digital form for easier processing.</string>
    <string name="pulseCompressionText">Pulse Compression is the process of getting the best possible resolution out of the received pulse/time data. This will try to differentiate between target data and other generic noise</string>
    <string name="dopplerProcessingText">Doppler Processing determines whether or not the frequency has shifted between transmitting and receiving, which will provide velocity information about the target.</string>
    <string name="detectionText">After the signal has been processed, the Detection process determines how many distinct targets have been detected above a given noise threshold.</string>
    <string name="trackingText">Tracking and Parameter Estimation keeps track of the detected targets from one set of pulses to another to get a good estimate of the range, bearing, and velocity of each distinct target.</string>
    <string name="consoleShamelessPlug">Console / Display - This is whatever you choose to view your Radar Data with.</string>
    <string name="recordingText">It can be useful to record radar data for later viewing.</string>
